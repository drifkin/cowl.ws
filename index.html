            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
            Modern web applications are conglomerations of JavaScript written by multiple
            authors: application developers routinely incorporate code from third-party
            libraries, and <i>mashup</i> applications synthesize data and code hosted at different
            sites. In current browsers, a web application's developer and user must trust
            third-party code in libraries not to leak the user's sensitive information from
            within applications. Even worse, in the status quo, the only way to implement
            some mashups is for the user to give her login credentials for one site to the
            operator of another site.  Fundamentally, today's browser security model trades
            privacy for flexibility because it lacks a sufficient mechanism for <i>confining
            untrusted code</i> once it reads sensitive data.
            </p>

            <p>
            COWL is a robust JavaScript confinement system for modern web
            browsers.  COWL introduces label-based <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control">mandatory access
            control</a> to browsing contexts (pages, iframes, etc.) in a way that is fully
            backward-compatible with legacy web content. With COWL, developers can not only
            restrict with whom they share data, but additionally impose restrictions on how
            their data is disseminated once it is shared.  COWL eliminates the
            flexibility-privacy divide by allowing code to (flexibly) fetch and shared data
            as necessary; to ensure user privacy COWL only confines the code, by revoking
            these rights, once the code has read read sensitive data.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            The COWL design naturally extends the existing web security model with three
            core concepts on top of which developers can build privacy preserving
            web-services. These concepts are:
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h4>Labeled contexts</h4>
            <p>
            Today, <i>contexts</i> -- in the form of tabs, pages, or iframes -- are
            used to isolate content from different origins (web sites).
            COWL extends these context with <i>labels</i>, which encode the origins
            from where the context has read information.
            In turn, COWL uses these labels to restrict how the code within the
            context communicates, i.e., it confines the code to disallow
            any communication that would result in leaking an origin's sensitive data.
            Since COWL is backwards-compatible, these restrictions are imposed atop 
            existing discretionary policies, such as the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</a> and 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy">CSP</a>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h4>Labeled communication</h4>
            <p>
            To impose restrictions on how third-party code can use sensitive data,
            developers can label data before handing it off to the third-party context (e.g., using <var>postMessage</var>).
            In turn, when the third-party code decides to use the data, COWL "taints" its
            context label to confine the executing code.
            This is different from today's model which effectively forces the developer
            to chose between using the third-party code or risk leaking the shared data.
            With COWL, the developer can use the library but ensure its confined once granted access to sensitive information.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h4>Privileges</h4>
            <p>
    In today's model, when the browser retrieves a page from https://example.com,
    any script within the context for the page is trusted not to violate the
    security concerns of https://example.com.  This is natural: https://example.com
    should be allowed to dictate how its data is disseminated! In COWL, this notion
    of <i>trust</i> is made explicit with <i>privileges</i>. 
    Privileges enable code to act on behalf of the page's origin and thus avoid
    getting confined when reading data sensitive to its origin. Equally important,
    however, COWL allows code to "drop" its privileges or delegate them to other
    trustworthy code. Developers can use this to build <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">least-privileged</a>
    applications.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>
This simple design is amendable to a fast browser layout engine-level
implementation, with no modifications to the underlying JavaScript engines.
Moreover, it allows us to simply extend already-familiar concepts (e.g.,
concepts, postMessaging, and XMLHttpRequest), as a way of giving developers
additional control over the privacy of the data they curate.
Our example (see link above) illustrates how the COWL API can be used to
confine a third-party password-strength checker library; our paper details
sever other common application patterns.

            <h3>Example: Confining  a password strength checker with COWL</a></h3>
            <p>
            COWL can be used to build several common types of applications, securely.
            Our paper describes several examples, including an
            encrypted document-editor, a banking app that relies on jQuery, a third-party
            mashup, and a password strength checker. We will release the code for all of these soon,
            but for now let's see how we can confine a third-party library such as
            a password-strength checker.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a page developer of https://example.com I want to use the password strength
            checker from http://sketchy.ru/checker.js. Maybe the developers at sketchy.ru are not
            malicious, but I don't trust them to write bug-free code.
            In particular, the checker may need to communicate with sketchy.ru to fetch data
            that it needs to do its job.
            (For a more realistic library, e.g., the syntax highlighter running in this page, this is desirable functionality.)
            How do I use COWL to ensure that the checker won't leak my password to sketchy.ru or any
            other site?
            </p>

            <div>
            <h4> Step 1: load the checker in a new labeled context </h4>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
   // In example.com page, create new context:
   var checker = new LWorker("http://sketchy.ru/checker.js");
</pre>

            An <var>LWorker</var> is a light-weight labeled worker, COWL's
            approach to creating cheap labeled contexts. (They are similar to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_worker">Web Workers</a>,
            but labeled and run in the same thread as the parent.)
            This code is simply creates a new context and starts running the untrusted
            checker code in this context.
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4> Step 2: register handler to get result</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
   // In example.com page, register message handler waiting for result
   checker.onmessage = function(result) {
     console.log('Password is: ' + result.toString());
   };
</pre>
            Since all communication between labeled contexts is done by
            message-passing, we registers a handler which is invoked once the
            checker send us the result.
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4> Step 3: send password</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
   // Is the password sensitive? Yes, label it with example.com!
   var labeledPassword = new LabeledBlob(password, "http://example.com");
   // Send the checker the labeled password:
   checker.postMessage(labeledPassword);
</pre>

            Finally, let's send the checker the password so it can do its job.
            Since the password is senstive, though, we label it with the
            origin it's sensitive to: example.com. Now when when the checker
            reads the password, it will be confined!
            </div>

            <div>
            <h4> The checker code</h4>
            <p>
            Our code expects the checker to use message passing, what might
            the this code look like? Here is one e.g.:
            </p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
  // In checker.js, register handler waiting for request from parent:
  onmessage = function(labeledPass) {
    if (doneLoading) {
      var password = labeledPass.blob; // Extract password => taints context!
      // Cannot communicate with sketchy.ru anymore, but can reply to parent:
      postMessage(checkStrength(password));
    }
  };
  // .. use XHLHttpRequest to communicate with arbitrary sites
</pre>

            This checker code starts out unconstrained: it can communicate with arbitrary
            web sites to fetch any data it needs.
            However, once it finished doing so (indicated by <var>doneLoading</var>)
            and the parent supplied it the labeled password, it can proceed to check
            the strength of the password. Specifically, in the <var>onmessage</var> handler,
            the code extracts the password from the labeled blob -- at which point COWL
            taints the context -- and computes the strength with the
            <var>checkStrength</var> function.
            Once the code inspected the password COWL confined it, preventing it from
            communicating arbitrarily.
            The code can, of course, send the containing example.com page the
            strength of the password.
            </div>
            <div>
            <h4> Take-away: privacy AND functionality</h4>
            Though a simple example, this illustrates an important feature not achievable today:
            the password strength checker has the <i>flexibility</i> to communicate as necessary,
            only once it actually inspects the password should it be confined from communicating
            arbitrarily as to ensure <i>privacy</i>. Today we either get functionality by allowing
            the checker to communicate arbitrarily, even after reading sensitive data, or privacy by
            disallowing it from communicating at all (or not using the library in the first place).
